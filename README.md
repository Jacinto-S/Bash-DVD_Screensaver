# Bash-DVD_Screensaver
The traditional dvd screensaver but for bash.

This is one of my first projects. Playing around with Ansii sequences, I wanted to make something that uses the color-changing features.

The screensaver will start automatically when executing the java file. 
To stop the application and have your bash's text-colour reset, press enter.

Features:
- Program Self-Adjusts when changing Window Size
- Logo bouncing of corners
- Logo changing color

To run this, build it using Maven. The resulting .jar file can be run with java -jar filename

Planned:
- Make this automatically run from bash after inactivity.
- Settings
